# My-First-Repo Project Report

# About:
Our project, "Wild Serve," is a multiplayer Tennis Game that garners awareness towards the critical issue of animal poaching. This theme is reflected through the monkey and the bear as the two players in our game, and a hunter as the ball to showcase an ironic take on traditional poaching. Our game has similar premises as a pong game; each player will be able to move their character using the "W" and "S" keys for the monkey or "⬆︎" and "⬇︎" keys for the bear. The objective is to hit the ball to the other player without failing to catch it. We'll include a loading screen with the title of our game, and either user can press the spacebar to start the game. We will also include a score count system based on the rules of an actual tennis game. Additionally, the visuals and fonts in our game will reflect similar jungle-aesthetics as the Jumanji game and movie series to better demonstrate our theme.

# Plan for the upcoming weeks:
In the coming weeks, we'll be adding cool visuals and effects to our game so that it matches the aesthetics of our theme. We'll create a start screen displaying the title of our game and also a score count for each player. Additionally, we plan on adding sound effects and a popup text saying "Wild Serve, You Win!" when either player wins. Lastly, we will also add a fence and some other visuals so the game looks like an actual tennis court.
